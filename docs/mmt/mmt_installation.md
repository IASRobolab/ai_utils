# MMT installation
First of all, clone the custom MMT repository, which contains the setup.py file, in a chosen directory (this should not 
change after installation). This repository has been slightly modified by the Robolab Leonardo fellows.

To install MMT on your pip environment, activate your environment (or install directly on system if you prefer) and run:
``` commandline
  cd YOUR_MMT_PATH/MMT
  python setup.py install
```
