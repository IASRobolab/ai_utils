# Midas installation

To install Midas on your pip environment, clone the code at [Midas](https://github.com/IASRobolab/MiDaS), enter in the MiDaS directory, activate your environment (or install directly on system if you prefer) and run:
``` commandline
  pip install -e .
```
The dependences would be installed autonomously except for torch and torchvision.
